## ✨ Idea of 'play and code'
We live in an era of short videos and booming AI tools.
You no longer need to watch over 100 lengthy theoretical lessons or solve over 1,000 boring exercises just to start coding.
Today, you can open ChatGPT, write a few prompts, and boom — you get a 200-line piece of code that builds a fully working website.

But here’s the real question:
Do you actually understand a single line of that code?
Would you be able to move a button just one pixel to the left?

In most cases, no — and that’s okay.
Because to build intuition for programming, you don’t need complex math or deep theory.
You just need to learn the grammar of code — the small building blocks from which everything else is created.

And that’s exactly why we created EchoPet.

EchoPet turns learning programming into a game.
You become a “trainer” for adorable digital pets who are trying to learn how to code.
Your mission is to guide them: answer their questions, help them solve problems, settle their arguments, upgrade their skills, earn rewards, and level up — all while having fun.

No pressure.
No overwhelming textbooks.
Just you, your pets, and a playful introduction to the foundations of coding.
